#+TITLE: DBStress
A small testcase for testing database performance.
Implements a few /endpoints/ for inserting, querying and updating Records so that
stress testing applications may be used.
* Roadmap
** Benchmarking
   Would like to measure DaoS (stream time) vs Dao (regular time).
   It is entirely possible that I am using streams wrong, though.
